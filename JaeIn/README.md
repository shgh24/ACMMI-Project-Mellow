# JaeIn's Analysis Folder

I built the full data-processing pipeline for importing and cleaning all Qualtrics survey data, including demographic information and GAD-7, PHQ-8, and STAI responses. This work included:

- Standardizing and cleaning participant IDs  
- Computing total scores for each psychological scale  
- Creating derived features such as anxiety and depression level  
- Exporting all processed survey features into a model-ready CSV file

I also created protocol documents and participant-facing materials needed for data collection, including the session workflow, instructional guides, and explanation materials. This work included: 
- Recruitment Flyer
- Protocl instruction
- updated study details
