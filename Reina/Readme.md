## Reina's Classical ML Folder 

- WESAD feature extraction and analysis
- Moly data extraction and alignment
- Moly feature extraction following same windowing strategy as WESAD
- Benchmarking 6 models on WESAD
- 3 comparative ML experiments: single-signal wrist comparison, multimodal single-wrist fusion, and bilateral vs single-wrist efficiency
- per-participant bilateral benefit variability and "optimal-wrist" configuration based on signal-level findings
- Signal processing for TEMP, ACC, EDA (separately for ML)
